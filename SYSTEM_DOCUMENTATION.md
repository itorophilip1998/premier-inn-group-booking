## System Overview

The Premier Inn Group Booking System is a modern web application designed to handle group booking requests for Premier Inn hotels. The system is built using Next.js, React, and TypeScript, providing a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution for managing group bookings.

### Key Features

- Multi-language support (English and German)
- Dark/Light theme switching
- Responsive design for all devices
- Form validation and error handling
- Real-time feedback and animations
- Accessibility compliance
- Comprehensive testing

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The application follows a modern React architecture with Next.js 15.3.3, utilizing the App Router pattern. The architecture is organized into the following layers:

1. **Pages Layer**

   - Handles routing and page composition
   - Located in `src/app/[locale]/*`
   - Implements internationalization at the route level

2. **Components Layer**

   - Reusable UI components
   - Located in `src/components/*`
   - Follows atomic design principles

3. **Context Layer**

   - Global state management
   - Located in `src/context/*`
   - Handles application-wide state

4. **Services Layer**
   - API integration
   - Business logic
   - Located in `src/services/*`

## Components

### Core Components

1. **Layout Components**

   - `RootLayout`: Main application layout
   - `ThemeProvider`: Theme management
   - `BookingProvider`: Booking state management

2. **UI Components**

   - `Logo`: Animated Premier Inn logo
   - `ThemeSwitcher`: Theme toggle component
   - `LanguageSwitcher`: Language selection component

3. **Form Components**
   - `GroupBookingForm`: Main booking form
   - `FormField`: Reusable form field component
   - `ValidationMessage`: Form validation messages

### Component Architecture

Each component follows these principles:

- Client/Server component separation
- Proper hydration handling
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance optimization
- Type safety with TypeScript

## Services

### API Integration

The system integrates with various services:

1. **Booking Service**

   - Handles group booking submissions
   - Validates booking data
   - Manages booking state

2. **Internationalization Service**

   - Manages translations
   - Handles locale switching
   - Provides translation utilities

3. **Theme Service**
   - Manages theme state
   - Handles theme persistence
   - Provides theme utilities

## State Management

### Context Providers

1. **BookingContext**

   - Manages booking form state
   - Handles form submission
   - Stores booking data

2. **ThemeContext**
   - Manages theme state
   - Handles theme switching
   - Persists theme preference

### State Flow

1. User interactions trigger state updates
2. Context providers manage state changes
3. Components re-render based on state updates
4. State is persisted where necessary

## Internationalization

### Implementation

- Uses `next-intl` for translations
- Supports English and German
- Implements locale-based routing

### Translation Structure

```
messages/
├── en-GB.json    # English translations
└── de-DE.json    # German translations
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**

   - Component testing
   - Utility function testing
   - Context testing

2. **Integration Tests**

   - Form submission testing
   - API integration testing
   - State management testing

3. **E2E Tests**
   - User flow testing
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Performance testing

### Testing Tools

- Jest for unit and integration tests
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for E2E testing

## Performance Optimization

### Techniques Used

1. **Code Splitting**

   - Dynamic imports
   - Route-based splitting
   - Component lazy loading

2. **Image Optimization**

   - Next.js Image component
   - Responsive images
   - Lazy loading

3. **Caching**
   - Static page generation
   - API response caching
   - Client-side caching

## Security

### Security Measures

1. **Input Validation**

   - Form validation with Zod
   - API input sanitization
   - XSS prevention

2. **Authentication**

   - Secure session management
   - Token-based authentication
   - CSRF protection

3. **Data Protection**
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Secure headers
   - Data encryption
